    "text": "I started my career as a developer in 2018, focusing on front-end work for an e-commerce company. There, I acquired skills in PHP, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Sass, and Codeigniter. In early 2021, I was promoted to a junior full-stack developer position at a credit analysis company. I worked on various projects using PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, NodeJS, ReactJS, AWS, and Windows Server. I worked with various PHP frameworks, including Zend 1, Slim 3, OpenCart 2, Wordpress, and primarily Laravel. Projects ranged from small landing pages to complex e-commerce systems and integrations. In mid-2023, I took on the challenge of establishing a technology department in a company previously reliant on Wordpress for its projects. I played a key role in implementing new technologies and agile methodologies.",
